Based on some information he learns, Bucky believes that destiny is to become a porn star, despite he being a virgin and only having recently learned what masturbation is.

On the personal side, Bucky befriends a young diner waitress Kathy McGee, who helps Bucky find a place to live - albeit with an insensitive oaf named Gary who only wants to get into Kathy's pants - and navigate general life in the big city.

Jake Gibson's (Cam Gigandet) horoscope forecasts a perfect FIVE STAR DAY the morning of his birthday, but what's foretold as a flawless day unfolds to be far less than stellar. Jake's world turns upside down when all that could go wrong ... does. Determined that Astrology has no legitimacy, Jake embarks on a journey to test the theory of Astrology by finding the three people born the same time and place as himself - Sarah Reynolds (Jena Malone), Yvette Montgomery (Brooklyn Sudano) and Wesley Henderson (Max Hartman). The journey quickly uproots Jake from the small college town of Berkeley, California, to downtown Chicago where he sets out to find and interview Sarah, Yvette and Wesley to see if their birthdays proved to be as deplorable as his own. Jake's pursuit in finding his three Astrological matches (or Zodiac twins) will not only test his convictions, but validate how life's unexpected twists of fate can deliver much more than the anticipated. The unforeseen takes Jake from the Windy City, to the boardwalk of New Jersey's Atlantic City, to the bustling streets of New York. What Jake learns along the way is an important lesson about life, love, fate and destiny that will unexpectedly change his life forever.","1996-06-28",,,"5.8","film","false"

But when the lights came up, they all disappeared... Unless you had all the toys. In which case, the adventure never had to end. In backyards, playgrounds, basements, and bedrooms, Star Wars toys helped kids re-enact scenes from their favorite movies, and create entirely new dangers for Luke Skywalker and his friends to face. They were lusted after on holidays and birthdays, swapped with great cunning out on the school yard, and carefully collected like fine treasures. Like no toys before them, the action figures, space ships, play sets, and props were a phenomenon that swept the nation with as much force as the film that inspired them. Along the way they transformed both the toy and movie industries, earned those behind them vast amounts of wealth, and ultimately created a hobby that, 30 years later, still holds sway over not only the people who grew up with the toys, but also an entirely new generation of fans. Plastic Galaxy is a documentary that explores the groundbreaking and breathtaking world of Star Wars toys. Through interviews with former Kenner employees, experts, authors, and collectors, it looks at the toys' history, their influence, and the fond and fervent feelings they elicit today.","2014-11-22",,,"6.4","film","false"

The latest incident in the feud is an on-field brawl between the players worse than they have ever had, which results in an indefinite suspension of both teams from the league pending a full investigation. Each game not played results in a loss and thus less and less chance of either team reaching the post-schedule championship. Beyond the direct measures to have the league lift Invicta's suspension, its owner/president, JosÃ© Carlos Silva, believes another indirect measure is to win in the court of public opinion by currying favor with Philip Andrews, a British documentarian filming a movie about the feud, and whose cameras and stories he hopes will document that Invicta is the innocent victim. To curry that favor, JosÃ©, upon Philip's expression of interest, is pushing his innocent daughter, InÃªs Silva, to date Philip, in who she truly has no interest despite Philip being a decent man. Meanwhile, one Castelo player not involved in that on-field incident is Brit Paul Collins, who was out sick that game and who is nursing a broken heart over a recent break-up with his girlfriend, Danielle. However, Paul and InÃªs fall in love at first sight when they spot each other across a crowded room at a party. Despite the obstacles, Paul and InÃªs do clandestinely see each other, with Carla, InÃªs' paternal grandmother, and Dr. Lawrence, Paul's American physician, reluctantly being their co-conspirators, reluctant in that they are more cognizant about a Paul/InÃªs relationship being fraught with life long problems.

Driving the stars of low-budget movies, along with their fragile egos, to and from locations in the middle of nowhere, pushes Don's buttons in all of the wrong directions. When Luke, the young and self-absorbed writer/director challenges Don's authority, murder and mayhem ensues. The movie's Scream Queen' starlet, Riversa Red, to her dismay finds herself the target of Don's obsession. With his encyclopedic knowledge of her 'body' and body of work, Don worms his way onto Riversa's good side, no easy task. Not knowing whether to fear or friend Don, Riversa finds herself at the center of a cyclone with Luke and Don both vying for her attention. A mysterious Hotel Bellboy and an unknown 'watcher in the woods' lend themselves to the growing suspense as the cast and crew hold-up at Forest Grove Lodge. After a couple of grueling days into the movie shoot, Don goes berserk, getting himself kicked off of the show. But letting go of Don doesn't come without a price. When he shows up the next day, 9 mm handgun in tow, the cast and crew are forced to act in Don's own home movie. Those who make a stand are dealt a deadly hand and those that await their fate wish they never stepped into the 'Star Vehicle'. Once the wheels of horror start rolling, there's no turning back.","2005-02-22",,,"3.2","film","false"

Borg Invasion 4D ran from 2004 to 2008. The audience enters a small theater where physically present actors portraying the Star Fleet crew greet them. The story is told through prerecorded 3D film sequences and actors' interaction with them and the audience. The story takes place some time after the end of the ST: Voyager series. The audience takes the roll of guests on a secret space station where Doctor from Voyager works with researches on creating a new DNA strain that will be resistant to the Borg's assimilation techniques. The guests are there to have themselves tested and help the research in case their DNA contains the resistant strain. Then the Borg attack. Actors lead the audience through a couple of hallways as other actors dressed as the Borg assimilate the researchers. Finally, the audience and the 'surviving' actors reach another small theater that represents an escape shuttle and there a new series of prerecorded 3D film sequences starts. The shuttle launches but the Borg cube with the Queen inside captures it. As the Queen taunts the audience, the Borg are tearing the shuttle apart. Just as they are about to reach the audience, a familiar, charmingly raspy, friendly female voice is heard as well as the sound of proton torpedoes. She disagrees that resistance is futile and is there to prove it.","1980-03-22",,,"8","film","false"

A planet from another solar system drifts into Earth's system and is detected by some Earth scientists who investigate. The surface of this planet is no longer habitable and the residents have moved to a high-tech underground city. The society is ruled by the women, who of course, are all beautiful. Men are considered mentally inferior and are divided into two categories: the 'adequately intelligent' who are selected by women to act as their personal 'domestics' for household chores, and the remainder who are forced to perform menial labor under the supervision of female guards. The guards are attired nicely in visored helmets, boots, hot pants, and elbow-length gloves which are used to control the men through some sort of apparent force. Scientists from Earth (one men and one woman) find their way to the planet, and are forced to take their stated places in society. The man is chosen as a domestic, sometimes is forced to work on a city maintenance crew, and the woman is assigned a white-collar job.

To smile, to take everything as a joke, to laugh out loud, or to allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by reality. To be painfully aware of the distance between us and our dreams, of the obstacles, and the fact that we are alone all the time. Some choose to escape, to build their own world, with it's own rules, with the memories of fairy tales and dreams that really come to be. A world where three friends are brought together by the same destination. Or maybe, it all comes down to daydreaming. And feeling the empty spaces with music.

During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford's acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford's personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan's unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford's films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman's Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964.","1996-02-12",,,"2.7","film","false"

Moved by Priscilla's passion and impressed with her natural talent and undeniable charisma, he begins to teach her all he knows about rapping. In the four years that follow there is no question that rapping has brought Priscilla closer to her estranged father, and that her success has made him proud. Before our eyes, this father-daughter duo go from a one-bedroom shelter in Harlem to a 4 bedroom apartment, from food stamps to shopping sprees, from rapping on street corners to sold out night clubs, and from sneaking under train turnstiles without the $2 fare to spare to being driven around in tinted SUV's. It is further undeniable that Jesse has been reborn, from looking at old photos and bitterly reflecting on how he never was given the respect he deserved in the music business as a rapper himself to finding his own voice and self-respect as his daughter's overzealous manager. But in the efforts to make her dad proud, Priscilla struggles to remain a child and finds herself trapped in a world of people twice her size and four times her age and doesn't know who to trust. Jesse himself is caught between wanting to protect his daughter' innocence and exploiting her raw talent to fulfill his deferred dream. All they know is that the ride has just begun.","1982-11-19",,,"7.8","film","false"

Is That You? (1976), co-starring Pearl Bailey, Michael Warren, Dennis Dugan and Tamara Dobson. The movie is produced and directed by George Schlatter. The movie tells the story of a man, played by Foxx, whose wife has run off with his brother and who as a result goes to visit his only son, Norman, played by Warren, in Los Angeles for some sympathy, but receives something else entirely. The making of this family-centric storied movie is very much as a family, as Foxx, Bailey and Schlatter have been friends for years and treat each other as family.","1988-02-15",,,"4.9","film","false"

Their journey exposes them to danger and cruelty; however it also exposes them to the unexpected kindness of the people involved in the Underground Railroad. These experiences will change Ben and Moses forever. Upon reaching the relative safety of Mt. Gilead Church on Buckingham Mountain, Ben and Moses get to experience life as free men and cross paths with historical figures such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Joshua and Jonathan Fell.

While the Castro brothers face their certain end, an uncertain future hangs over the island. Some people are afraid, many cannot wait, but all shudder and hope that the changes will be positive. This documentary leads the audience through the discovery of this hope, through a tourist's camera which looks to be turned off and oblivious to the conversation at hand, yet is focused on candidly capturing each person's wishes. There is the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls - those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only try to escape abroad. Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling their bodies - the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury resorts is openly displayed beyond censorship's control. One special guide is Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution - the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks about her country's ruin, and where Raul's reforms have no effect on everyday life. Castro's supporters and dissidents, young and old - none deceive themselves that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer. And this is what this project focuses on: the wishes on a falling star.","1988-07-01",,,"8.5","film","false"

He claimed to be from Mars, so Xiao Bo brought him home in order to teach him a thing or two about life on Earth. Dubbed 'ET' by his human hosts, the curious alien soon reveals that he has been sent to this planet in order to learn as much as possible about physical interaction. Bisexual Xiao Bo has both a girlfriend and a boyfriend, neither of whom are particularly thrilled that Xiao Bo has brought home a new lover. Later, when Xiao Bo's girlfriend attempts to have a child with 'ET,' the alien falls into a deep coma. Now the way to revive 'ET' is for Xiao Bo to utter the words 'I love you.'

Some levels in this game are on a fixed path, similar to Space Harrier or Star Fox. Other levels allow your space craft to hover freely around a 3D environment, and in other levels your craft transforms into a walker robot for close-up attacks. In Soulstar you are a warrior pilot known as Bryk Hammelt. It is your mission to prevent an alien aggressor known as the Myrkoids from draining the Soulstar system of its energy resources.","1980-04-27",,,"6.6","film","false"

The manager called his press agent in, scolded him and ordered him to secure a vaudeville team, adding that 'they must be extremely funny and extremely cheap.' Within a short time the agent returned and proudly announced he had found 'an absolute novelty, and a joint salary of $15.' 'I dodged all the agencies,' he explained, 'and down on one of the side streets I ran across an old-time ham actor. I followed him. He went into a laundry and tried to get his duds out without paying for them. Well, the woman who ran the joint was a regular comedy queen. She didn't say much, but she certainly was full of 'pep.' She nearly wrecked the laundry with that actor, and I never laughed so much in my life. When I offered them an engagement the man balked, but the woman accepted for both of them, saying he could work out his laundry bill anyhow.' The manager tried the act out, and it made a big hit. The morning papers gave much space to the 'Soap Suds Star,' Sophie, the laundress. Much to his dismay, however, the press agent found the manager in an extremely bad humor. 'It's all your fault,' he said bitterly, 'You get me to hire amateurs, and now they are going to be married, and quit vaudeville for the classics.' 'I think it a dandy idea,' said the agent. 'Sophie as Juliet would coin money for any manager. Why not try them out in the balcony scene' The manager, impressed, retained his 'Soap Suds Star,' and his leading man. Sophie s bad temper, however, spoiled her artistic career. She was on the job as Juliet, all right, but Romeo nearly missed the performance, and when he did appear he wore his street clothes, explaining with an alcoholic smile that he had been out with the boys and really had no time to dress. Sophie left her art to chastise him, but after a lively chase he escaped by leaping into the river, and the one-time actress returned to her laundry, believing she was a widow. But her husband came back and Sophie forgave him.
